            : Our mission is to connect people who might be passively looking
            for a job with the right opportunities and help employers find the
            best candidates for their open positions. Snapbrillia’s AI
            recruiting software helps companies of all sizes, including many
            Fortune 500 companies to find qualified people for their open job
            positions, probably someone just like you. To do this, we collect
            and share Candidate and Jobseeker Personal Information, including
            contact Information, professional and employment-related
            information, demographic information, photos and inferences drawn
            from the foregoing categories, with our business customers and
            Business Users for their job search and employment recruiting
            purposes. However, this sharing constitutes a sale under the CCPA,
            and we honor requests to opt-out.
