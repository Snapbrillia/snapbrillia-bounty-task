            sent to 1043 Garland Ave, Unit C #764, San Jose, CA 95126-3159. The

            arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any,
            to which you or SBA is entitled. All issues are for the arbitrator

            scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration
            Agreement. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, SBA agrees that you
            may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
            basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
            hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA. If
            your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be
            determined by the AAA. Regardless of the manner in which the
            arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned
            written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and

            18.4. Waivers of Class Action and Trial by Jury.
          </span>
          <span className="t0">
            &nbsp; YOU AND SBA BOTH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLASS
            ACTION INVOLVING DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES. BOTH YOU AND SBA ARE
            EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE
            BROUGHT IN A PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
            CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING,
            AND, UNLESS SBA AGREES OTHERWISE THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE
            MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN
            ESSENTIAL PART OF OUR ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT BE SEVERED.
            IF FOR ANY REASON THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS FOUND UNENFORCEABLE,
            THEN THE ENTIRE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT HEREIN WILL NOT APPLY.
            HOWEVER, THE WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY SET FORTH IN THIS
            SECTION WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT.

            individual action in small claims court. Nothing in the Terms
            precludes you from bringing issues to the attention of federal,
            state or local agencies. Nothing in the Terms will prevent either

            breaching the Terms or any part of the Agreement.{' '}
