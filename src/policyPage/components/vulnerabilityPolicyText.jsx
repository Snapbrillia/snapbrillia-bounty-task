            At Snapbrillia, we take the security of our users very seriously. If
            you believe you&#39;ve discovered a security vulnerability on or

            encourage you to inform us immediately. Publicly disclosing a
            vulnerability can put the entire community at risk, so we request
            that such vulnerability reports be kept in confidence and
            researchers not make those public until we have resolved the issue.
            We appreciate your assistance, and we review all reports and will
            make every effort to resolve the issue as fast as we can.
